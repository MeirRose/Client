    <h1>Queen are a British rock band formed in London in <br>
     1970. Their classic line-up was Freddie Mercury <br>
     (lead vocals and piano), Brian May (lead guitar and vocals), <br>
     Roger Taylor (drums and vocals), and John Deacon (bass guitar). <br>
     Their earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard<br>
     rock and  heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more <br> 
     conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further <br> 
     styles, such as arena rock and pop rock.</h1>
